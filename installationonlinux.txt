1. Installation on Linux (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Download & Extract
Connect to your Linux server via SSH and run the following:
Bash
# Update the system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install unzip
sudo apt install unzip -y

# Create a folder for Gophish
mkdir gophish && cd gophish

# Download the latest Linux 64-bit binary (check GitHub for the newest version)
wget https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/v0.12.1/gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip

# Extract the files
unzip gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip

# Make the file executable
chmod +x gophish

Step 2: Configure for Remote Access
By default, Gophish only allows you to access the admin panel from localhost. To access it from your own laptop, you need to edit the config file:
Bash
nano config.json

Find the admin_server section and change 127.0.0.1:3333 to 0.0.0.0:3333.
Security Note: Once you do this, your admin panel is public. Ensure your VPS firewall (UFW) only allows your specific IP address to connect to port 3333.
Step 3: Launch
Start Gophish for the first time:
Bash
sudo ./gophish

Important: Look at the terminal output. It will print a temporary admin password. Copy this immediately.
