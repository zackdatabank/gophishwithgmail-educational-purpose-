For Customer: __________________________ Date: __________

Tips for Implementation:
The "Double Check": Ensure the person signing this has the legal authority to authorize a security test (usually a CISO, CTO, or CEO).
Help Desk Notification: Decide whether the Help Desk should know about this. Usually, it's best to tell the Help Desk Manager so they don't get spooked, but tell them to keep it quiet from the Tier 1 staff to test their response too.
